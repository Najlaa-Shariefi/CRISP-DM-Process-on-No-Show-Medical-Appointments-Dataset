# CRISP-DM-Process-on-No-Show-Medical-Appointments-Dataset
This project is my implementation of the "CRISP-DM Process" to create a Github post and a blog. 

## Installation 
#### - Python version: 3.7.1
#### - Libraries used:
- Pandas
-	Numpy
-	Matplotlib
-	DateTime

## Project Motivation
This project is my implementation of the "CRISP-DM Process" to create a blog and a Github post to show off my skills in the Data Mining and Analysis as part of the graduation requirements of Udacity's [Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) certification.

#### CRISP-DM Process Steps are:
- Step 1: Business Understanding
- Step 2: Data Understanding
- Step 3: Prepare Data
-	Step 4: Data Modeling
-	Step 5: Evaluation
-	Step 6: Deployment

#### During the implementation of CRISP-DM Process the following Questions has been answered: 
- Are there specific days of the week where the percentages of no-show appointments occurrences increase?
- Do patients with a greater Number of Awaiting Days tend to miss their appointments more than those with fewer Awaiting Days? 
- Do patients receiving SMS reminders have more probability to show up for their appointments than those who have not received the SMS reminders?

## About the Data
The dataset that used on this project ,**"No-Show" Appointments Dataset,is a set of information collected from 100k medical appointments in Brazil For a period of six months of appointments' data has been included within the dataset.** It is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointments. Several characteristics about a patient are included in each row such as Gender, Age, Neighbourhood as well as the patient's primary health designation(s) including Hypertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, and whether the patient is handicapped or not.
